# MinutemanCTF 2024 - Source & binary

These are code I used for making MinutemanCTF 2024 challenges.

### ideas

- baby_asm: x86-64 add, imul, and calling convention
- dimension: Python program packed inside another Python program, extensively
- inception: (Training Platform) Program decrypts itself at run-time through executable section (self-decryption)
- outerspace: Base64 with a different alphabet
